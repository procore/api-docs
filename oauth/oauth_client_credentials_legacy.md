## Client Credentials Grant Flow Example

The following sections outline the basic building blocks for implementing the Client Credentials grant flow in your application.

> PRODUCTION VS. SANDBOX ENVIRONMENTS
>
> It is important to note that access/refresh tokens are not shared across production and sandbox environments.
> API calls you make to Procore resources in your production environment must use a separate set of authentication keys (client ID and client secret) from those used for your sandbox environment.
> In addition, API calls to production must use the https://api.procore.com base URL, while calls to your sandbox must use the https://sandbox.procore.com base URL.
> Keep in mind that the examples presented below use the production base URL, rather than the sandbox base URL.

### 1. Create Service Account in Procore

The first step to implementing the Client Credentials grant flow in your application is to log in to Procore and create a service account as descibed in our [support article](http://support.procore.com/products/online/user-guide/company-level/admin/tutorials/create-service-account).
Once the service account is created, you will have access to the `client_id` and `client_secret` generated by the system.

### 2. Retrieve Access Token

Once you have created a service account in Procore, you can retrieve an OAuth 2.0 access token by making a POST call to the [/oauth/token](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/authentication#get-or-refresh-an-access-token) endpoint in the Procore API.
The JSON payload for this call is formatted as follows:

```
{
  "grant_type": "client_credentials",
  "client_id": "242635f69bfc6fb9adax513875a0254a2a908f7bb176x1698d6x169a08f5646d",
  "client_secret": "041372a09c6e4x92aa08ce3axea1cfc0115cbfbf7134exa125fe10cc103ca626"
}
```

And here is a cURL example for calling the [/oauth/token](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/authentication#get-or-refresh-an-access-token) endpoint:

```
curl -F grant_type=client_credentials \
     -F client_id=242635f69bfc6fb9adax513875a0254a2a908f7bb176x1698d6x169a08f5646d \
     -F client_secret=041372a09c6e4x92aa08ce3axea1cfc0115cbfbf7134exa125fe10cc103ca626 \
     -X POST https://login.procore.com/oauth/token
```

The JSON response block from the call includes an `access_token` string and addtional attributes as shown here:

```
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9xeyJhaWQiOiIwY2I3ZDc1...",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "created_at": 1511289006
}
```

- `token_type` - value of "bearer" indicates that the Authorization header you pass when making Procore API calls will be the "bearer" type.
- `expires_in` - value of 7200 indicates that the access token is valid for 7200 seconds (2 hours).
- `created_at` - date/time the access token was genterated in UNIX time format.

### 3. Make a Test Call to the Procore API

Now that you have a valid access token you can make a test call to the Procore API. For this simple example, we will make a call to the [List Projects](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/projects#list-projects) endpoint to return a list of the active projects in our company.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9xeyJhaWQiOiIwY2I..." \
     -X GET https://api.procore.com/rest/v1.0/projects?company_id=7656
```

If successful, this call will return a JSON response block similar to the following:

```
{
  "id": 123456,
  "name": "Demo Account Project",
  "display_name": "Demo Account Project",
  "project_number": null,
  "address": "5678 First Street",
  "city": "Anytown",
  "state_code": "CA",
  "country_code": "US",
  "zip": "93013",
  "county": null,
  "latitude": 34.385045633646,
  "longitude": -119.490841957738,
  "stage": "Course of Construction",
  "phone": "",
  "created_at": "2016-08-22T20:18:55Z",
  "updated_at": "2017-10-23T21:19:34Z",
  "active": true,
  "origin_id": null,
  "origin_data": null,
  "company": {
      "id": 1234,
      "name": "My Construction Company"
  }
}
```

## Using Service Accounts with MPZ

If you intend to use service accounts with Multiple Procore Zones (MPZ), you _must_ include the `Procore-Company-Id` request header when making calls to the `/rest/v1.0/me` or `/rest/v1.0/companies` endpoints.

Here is a cURL example showing a call to `GET /rest/v1.0/me`:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9xeyJhaWQiOiIwY2I..." \
     -H "Procore-Company-Id: xxxxxxxxx" \
     -X GET https://api.procore.com/rest/v1.0/me
```

Here is a cURL example showing a call to `GET /rest/v1.0/companies`:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJFUzUxMiJ9xeyJhaWQiOiIwY2I..." \
     -H "Procore-Company-Id: xxxxxxxxx" \
     -X GET https://api.procore.com/rest/v1.0/companies
```

The value to use for the `Procore-Company-Id` header can be retrieved from the URL in the address bar of your browser once you have logged into a company.
The company ID displays in the URL as a path parameter as shown in the following example.

```
https://app.procore.com/<COMPANY ID>/company/home/list
```

Where: `<COMPANY ID>` is the integer value for the ID of the company you are currently logged into.
