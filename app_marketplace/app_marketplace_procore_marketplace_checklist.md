## Introduction
Before submitting your app to the Procore Marketplace, itâ€™s essential to review the Marketplace Checklist. This checklist covers all submission requirements and helps ensure your app meets our guidelines for a smooth review process.

By following the checklist, you can avoid common points of failure, reduce delays, and increase the chances of your app being approved on the first submission. We highly recommend reviewing these items well in advance of submitting your app to minimize potential issues.
