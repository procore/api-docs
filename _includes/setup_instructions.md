## Define Setup Instructions and Post-Installation Notes

You can define additional setup instructions and post-installation notes to help Procore users successfully install and set up your application within a Procore project.
Instructions are displayed to the user once an application is installed, and are accessible later from within the App Management feature in the Procore Admin tool.


* Expand the Instructions and Post-Installation Notes section.
* In the Instructions URL field, enter the web address for your company support site, or web-based installation steps for your application.
* In the Instructions Page Name field, enter the label you want to use for the hyperlink text for the Instructions URL you defined in step 2.
* In the Post-Installation Notes field, provide a textual description of any post-installation steps required to properly complete the setup of your application.
