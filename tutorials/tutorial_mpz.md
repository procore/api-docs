## Background

As part of an ongoing infrastructure improvement initiative, we've established Multiple Procore Regions (MPR) in our network topology.
MPR allows us to distribute our customer load across a larger pool of infrastructure to provide better scalability, durability, and security.
With MPR in place, we can distribute our infrastructure over multiple geographical locations.
With the rollout of MPR, you will need to adhere to specific implementation requirements and best practices when building solutions with the Procore API.
These requirements and best practices are presented in the following sections.

## MPR Architecture

The following diagram serves to illustrate the new MPR architecture.
The connections between the components are sequentially numbered and are annotated with the relevant attributes of the API requests/responses involved in obtaining an access token (steps 1-4) and using that access token to subsequently make a call to a Procore resource (steps 5-8).

## Required Changes

In order for your application to be compliant with the new MPR architecture, you will need to implement a number of changes as described below.

- **New Base Domain for OAuth 2.0 Authentication Requests** - The base domain for OAuth 2.0 Authentication endpoints has been changed from `app.procore.com` to `login.procore.com`. As a result, all authentication-related requests (i.e., requesting an authorization code, retrieving an access token, and refreshing an access token) must use `login.procore.com` as their base domain.
- **New Base Domain for Procore API Endpoints** - The base domain for Procore API endpoints has been changed from `app.procore.com` to `api.procore.com`. As a result, you will need to ensure that all the Procore API calls you make from your application to the production Procore environment use this new base domain.
- **New Request Header Requirement** - Each call your application makes to the Procore API must contain a request header that includes the `Procore-Company-Id` field. This request header field specifies the id of the company into which you are making the call. Here is a cURL example showing a call to the List Projects endpoint.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access token>‚Äù -H "Procore-Company-Id: xxxxxxxxx"
     -X GET https://api.procore.com/rest/v1.0/projects?company_id=xxxxxxxxx
```

In this example, we use -H flags to specify the `Authorization` and `Procore-Company-Id` request header fields.
It is important to note that even though an endpoint might require the `company_id` as a path or query parameter, MPR still requires you to include the `Procore-Company-Id` field in the request header.

If you do not supply the required request header, the following error message is displayed.

```
Missing Procore-Company-Id header!

Each call your application makes to the Procore API must contain a request header that includes the Procore-Company-Id field. 
This request header field specifies the id of the company into which you are making the call.
```

_Note_: The following Procore API endpoints _do not_ require a request header containing the `Procore-Company-Id` field:

- [Show User Info](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/me) - (GET /rest/v1.0/me)
- [List Companies](https://developers.procore.com/reference/rest/v1/companies) - (GET /rest/v1.0/companies)

The exception to this rule is when you are using Service Accounts with the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials grant type.
See [Using Service Accounts with MPR]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link oauth/oauth_client_credentials.md %}#using-service-accounts-with-mpz) for additional information.

## Actions Required / Timeline

- To continue serving existing Procore customers, you will need to make the above described changes by June 30, 2019, beyond which your apps and integrations may not work.
- To onboard new Procore customers, you will need to make these changes by October 31, 2018.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to make all these changes to my application immediately?

_Answer_: No.
Though we plan to complete the infrastructure changes for MPR by October 31, 2018, non-compliant applications will continue to function as expected for existing Procore Customers until June 30, 2019.
However, you will not be able to access data from _new_ Procore customers.

### What happens if I never make these changes to my application?

_Answer_: It depends on your particular scenario:

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Existing Procore Customer w/ custom integration | Assuming the customer is in the US01 Region (the default region), they will not experience any adverse effects until June 30, 2019 unless they are requested to migrate to a different region prior to that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| New Procore Customer w/ custom integration      | New customers would not be able to access their company data without implementing the `Procore-Company-Id` request header field, and adopting the new API gateway domain (api.procore.com) and the new Authentication gateway (login.procore.com).                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| System Integrator                               | Integrations built by system integrators will continue to work for existing Procore users in the US01 Region until June 30, 2019. However, they will not be able to build integrations for new users without implementing the `Procore-Company-Id` request header field, and adopting the new API gateway domain (api.procore.com) and the new Authentication gateway (login.procore.com).                                                       |
| Procore Technology Partner                      | Marketplace Apps built by Procore Technology Partners will continue to work for their existing Procore users in the US01 Region until June 30, 2019. However, their integrations will not support any new Procore users who are placed in a region other than US01 until the `Procore-Company-Id` request header field is implemented and the new API gateway (api.procore.com) and the new Authentication gateway (login.procore.com) is adopted. |

### Will the MPR architecture changes impact my sandbox environments?

_Answer_: Yes.
There are several changes to be aware of with respect to how you will interact with your monthly and development sandbox environments:

- When making API calls to the Procore authentication server, you must use the following base URLs depending on the environment:
    - _Monthly Sandbox_ - use the `https://login-sandbox-monthly.procore.com/oauth` base URL.
    - _Development Sandbox_ - use the `https://login-sandbox.procore.com/oauth` base URL.
- When making API calls to Procore resources, you must use the following base URLs depending on the environment:
    - _Monthly Sandbox_ - use the `https://api-monthly.procore.com` base URL.
    - _Development Sandbox_ - use the `https://sandbox.procore.com` base URL.
- When making API calls to a sandbox environment, you must include the `Procore-Company-Id` request header as described above.
