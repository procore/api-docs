## Overview

After you have completed the development phase of your integration project, you may consider submitting your App for publication on the [Procore Marketplace](https://marketplace.procore.com/).
This is an optional step that only applies to Apps that you intend to publish to the Marketplace.
Please ensure the content you supply for your Marketplace Listing - descriptions, screenshots, video, etc. - accurately reflects the App’s core experience.
Once you have everything assembled you can log in to your Procore Developer Portal account and visit your App page to enter and submit information for your Marketplace Listing.
Here are the high-level steps for submitting your Marketplace Listing information.

- On each of the tabs in the Marketplace Listing page, enter the information you want to display on the App tile that customers see on the Marketplace.
- After entering your information, click **Save Draft**.
You can return to and update any of the field values at a later time if you wish.
- Once you are satisfied with your Marketplace Listing, click **Submit for Review**.
You will be notified by email regarding the results of our review.

If you have any specific questions you can click **Contact Us** at the bottom of the Marketplace Listing page to reach out to our Marketplace validation team.

## Prerequisites

Access to Procore's Marketplace is reserved for Procore Partners who have completed the vetting questionnaire and agreed to the Partnership Terms.
Once your status is confirmed, you can use the Marketplace Listing page to input the information required for your App and submit the listing for review.
If you do not intend to list your App on the Marketplace, you can skip this section.

When you access the Marketplace Listing page for the first time you are asked to either continue as an existing Procore Partner or complete a Procore Partner application.

- If you are already a Procore Partner, click **Request Listing Activation**.
